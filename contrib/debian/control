Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bish Core

 This package provides bish-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a bish daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
